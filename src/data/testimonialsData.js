    review:
      "Med On Time service during COVID 19 is magnificent. It gives good discounts than medical shops. The App is very simple to choose and the service is very much proficient and prompt. Pretty satisfied with the service. Good Part is you need not spend huge bucks on Doctor's prescribed medical shops which is other big relief. Way to GO",

    review:' I have been using Med On Time for more than 3 years. I buy medicines for myself. The ease of ordering and offers are good. Helps me save money. Especially during COVID-19, I am scared to stepout of the house. Med On Time provides timely deliveries & contactless delivery. Customer support is fantastic providing immediate response & resolution',
